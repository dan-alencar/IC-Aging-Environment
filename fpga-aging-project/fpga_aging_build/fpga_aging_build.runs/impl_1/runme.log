Phase 1.2 IO Placement/ Clock Placement/ Build Placer Device
WARNING: [Place 30-675] Sub-optimal placement for a global clock-capable IO pin and BUFG pair.This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	fpga_button_IBUF_inst/IBUFCTRL_INST (IBUFCTRL.O) is locked to IOB_X0Y89
	i_rstgen/i_rstgen_bypass/i_tc_clk_mux2_rst_n/i_BUFGMUX (BUFGCTRL.I0) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y14
	i_rstgen/i_rstgen_bypass/i_tc_clk_mux2_rst_no/i_BUFGMUX (BUFGCTRL.I1) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y5
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The global clock-capable IO (GCIO) is placed on a GCIO capable site (b) The BUFG is placed in the same bank of the device as the GCIO pin. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
