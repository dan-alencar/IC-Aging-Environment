CLKC-56#1 Advisory
MMCME4 with global clock driver has no LOC  
The MMCME4_ADV cell clock_gen/inst/mmcme4_adv_inst CLKIN1 or CLKIN2 pin is driven by global Clock buffer(s) clock_gen/inst/clkin1_bufg1 and does not have a LOC constraint. It is recommended to LOC the MMCM and use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on the net(s) driven by the global Clock buffer(s).
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 18 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
