XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-from : [get_pins -hierarchical -filter {NAME =~ *ila_core_inst/u_trig/N_DDR_TC.N_DDR_TC_INST[*].U_TC/allx_typeA_match_detection.ltlib_v1_0_3_allx_typeA_inst/DUT/u_srl_drive/CLK}]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '44' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].

CLKC-32#1 Advisory
MMCME4 CLKOUT with phase shift drives no IOs  
The MMCME4 cell clock_gen/inst/mmcme4_adv_inst has non-zero CLKOUT2_PHASE phase-shift for CLKOUT2, but that clock output does not drive an I/O. Using a phase-shift is not a recommended method for internal paths timing closure and it also uses more power.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-56#1 Advisory
MMCME4 with global clock driver has no LOC  
The MMCME4_ADV cell clock_gen/inst/mmcme4_adv_inst CLKIN1 or CLKIN2 pin is driven by global Clock buffer(s) sys_clk_in_BUFG_inst and does not have a LOC constraint. It is recommended to LOC the MMCM and use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on the net(s) driven by the global Clock buffer(s).
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 16 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
